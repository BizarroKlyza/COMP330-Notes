## Transformations in 3D

*Len's breaking out the models again*

Remember TRaSHeS.

`Pw = T()R()SH()S() Pm`

Point in the world equals each matrix multiplied. Matrices in 2d allow us to combine transformations.

### 3D

Point in 3D = `[x y z 1]` <br>
Vector in 3d = `[x y z 0]`

Homogeneous matrix
```Javascript
ix jx bx tx
iy jy by ty
iz jz bz tz
 0  0  0  1
```

### Heaps of Trash

We got a new mnemonic lads.

***H***ea***P***e***R***

Just like TRaSHeS for 2d, we use HeaPeR to remember the order of 3D transformations.

Heading <br>
Pitch <br>
Roll
